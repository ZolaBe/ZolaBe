- 👋 Hi, I introduce myself as Zola, whenever I think my full name will prevent us from talking about other stuff. Somehow, people have a problem with 8 letter (4 sylabus) name when it is foregin.
-  
- 👀 I’m interested in mainly in Optics in general (Fourier optics, especially) and computational lithography ticks a nerve whenever I have a challenge to solve in this topics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine learning and apply it to lithography and optics in general. Also, I also want to explore application of ML for FinTech.
- Also, I love a clean code (that looks like an art). I have a technical background from STEM and I still would like to learn the intricate details of
- effective and beautful code and algorithms. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Computational lithography and Optics, ML, C++, Python, 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
